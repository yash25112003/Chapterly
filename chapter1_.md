## Chapter 1: The Whispering Walls

The old Victorian mansion loomed against the bruised twilight sky, its silhouette a jagged claw against the dying light. Rain lashed against the leaded windows, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the silence.  Amelia shivered, pulling her threadbare coat tighter around her. This place, Blackwood Manor, was a monument to forgotten grandeur, its once vibrant paint now peeling like sunburnt skin. 

She'd inherited the house from a distant aunt she barely remembered, a woman whispered to be eccentric, even mad. The locals spoke of strange occurrences within the manor's walls, of shadows that danced in the corners of your eye and voices that echoed on the wind. Amelia, a pragmatic journalist, had dismissed these tales as folklore, the product of a superstitious community clinging to the past. 

But now, standing on the overgrown path, a prickle of unease crawled up her spine. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay, and the silence was broken only by the relentless drumming of the rain.  

Taking a deep breath, Amelia pushed open the creaking oak door. The hinges groaned in protest, their rusty lament echoing through the cavernous hall. Dust motes danced in the slivers of light that pierced through the grimy windows, illuminating a grand staircase that spiraled upwards into the gloom. 

A chill, deeper than the autumn air, settled over her. It wasn't just the cold; it was a feeling of being watched, of unseen eyes boring into her from the shadows. 

Amelia stepped cautiously inside, her footsteps echoing on the worn marble floor. The air was thick with the musty scent of time and neglect. Cobwebs draped the ornate chandeliers, their crystal prisms catching the faint light and scattering it in a thousand glittering shards. 

She ran her hand along the cold, smooth surface of a mahogany table, its surface covered in a thick layer of dust. A single, faded photograph lay face down on the table, its edges curled and brittle. Amelia picked it up, her fingers brushing against the worn paper. 

It was a portrait of a woman, her face pale and ethereal, her eyes staring out with an unsettling intensity. A name, barely legible, was scrawled on the back: Eleanor Blackwood. 

A sudden gust of wind rattled the windows, sending a shiver down Amelia's spine. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. She felt a presence, something unseen, watching her from the shadows. 

"Hello?" she called out, her voice trembling slightly. 

Only silence answered.
